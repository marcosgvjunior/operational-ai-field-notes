# Data Directory

This directory contains the necessary data assets for running the project's notebooks, as well as a location for any outputs they generate.

## Guiding Principle

**Keep it small.** This repository is for code and examples, not for storing large datasets. The data included here is minimal and is intended only to provide the necessary inputs for the demonstration notebooks to run successfully.

## Directory Structure

*   `input/`: This subdirectory contains all the input assets required by the notebooks.
    *   `images/`: Contains a small set of sample PNG images (`image1.png`, `image2.png`, etc.) that are used as inputs for the object detection models in the notebooks.

*   `coco_labels.json`: A JSON file containing the 80 class labels for the standard MS COCO dataset. This is used by the notebooks to map the numeric output of COCO-trained models to human-readable class names (e.g., "person", "car").

*   `output/` (Optional & Git Ignored): This directory is designated as the default location for any images or data generated by running the notebooks. It is included in the `.gitignore` file, ensuring that generated outputs are not committed to the version control system.
